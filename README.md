Coursework and Projects from the UT Dallas Human Language Technologies course

## Assignment 0: Overview_of_NLP
A document covering the general idea of NLP

[Overview of NLP document](Overview_of_NLP.pdf)

## Assignment 1: Text Processing
A program that opens a data file with employee info, processes the data to the proper format,
and displays the information

[Link to open python file](Text_Processing.py)

### How to run the program
1. Create a new project (I used Pycharm, but you can use any IDE)
2. In the project, create a new folder called data
3. download [this data file](data.csv) and place it inside the data folder (Note: I did not create the data file, it was provided to me for the assignment)
4. If using Pycharm, edit the configurations of the python file and in the **Parameters** section type **data/data.csv**
5. Run the program

### Reflections
Strengths/Weaknesses:

Personally, I think Python works pretty well for text processing, as there are a lot of built-in functions that allow you
to break up text and manipulate it to what you need. Python also has a lot of libraries that give you a lot of options on
how you want to process your text. However, Python is slower compared to other languages, which may not make it the best
choice if you need to process a lot of text quickly. I personally also like being explicit in what types of data structures I am
using so I won't forget, and Python does not allow that since it has dynamic types

What I Learned/Reviewed:

In this assignment, I learned how to code a simple program using Python, as I had never used Python prior to this assignment. I also reviewed how to do simple regex expressions to recognize specific types of strings. Finally, I learned how to do sysarg in Python as well as what a pickle is
and how to create and read one.
